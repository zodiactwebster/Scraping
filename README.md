# Scraping
I have had an opportunity to use an API or do web scraping for a couple of different class assignments so far. 
1. Using a weather API to extract temperatures for a specific date range. This assignment spurred me to organize a share-a-thon for code so newer learners like me could learn from more experienced coders. I learned many tricks from that sharing. The stand-out was in date-processing. WeatherScrape.py is what I turned in for that assignment. 
2. Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup for salary data of sports players was part of one of my coursera courses. I don't seem to have saved that work outside of the IBM Watson platform I used for Jupyter notebook processing.
